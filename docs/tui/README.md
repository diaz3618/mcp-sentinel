# TUI Guide

Argus MCP includes an interactive terminal UI built with
[Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/). The TUI connects to a running
Argus server via the management API and provides real-time monitoring,
capability browsing, and server control.

## Launching

```bash
# Connect to local server (default: http://127.0.0.1:9000)
argus-mcp tui

# Connect to remote server
argus-mcp tui --server http://192.168.1.100:9000

# With authentication
argus-mcp tui --token my-management-token

# Multi-server mode
argus-mcp tui --servers-config ~/.config/argus-mcp/servers.json
```

See [`argus-mcp tui`](../cli/tui.md) for all CLI options.

## Screens

The TUI has ten modes, accessible via keybindings or the command palette.

## Polling

The TUI polls the management API every 2 seconds to refresh:

- Health status
- Backend states
- Capabilities
- Events

### Connection Handling

- **Connection lost**: TUI shows a connection-lost indicator and continues
  polling. It will reconnect automatically when the server becomes available.
- **Connection restored**: TUI resumes normal operation and refreshes all data.

## Multi-Server Mode

With a `servers.json` config, the TUI shows a server selector widget allowing
you to switch between multiple Argus instances:

```json
{
  "servers": [
    { "name": "local", "url": "http://127.0.0.1:9000" },
    { "name": "staging", "url": "http://staging:9000", "token": "tok" }
  ],
  "active": "local"
}
```

The server selector appears at the top of the dashboard. Selecting a different
server reconnects the TUI to that instance.

## Theming

The TUI supports Textual's built-in themes. Cycle through themes with `n` or
open the theme picker with `T` (Shift+T) for a visual preview.

## Additional Screens

| Screen | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Elicitation | Handle elicitation requests from backends |
| Theme Picker | Visual theme selection with previews |
